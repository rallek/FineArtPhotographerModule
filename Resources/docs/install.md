# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy RKFineArtPhotographerModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/RK/FineArtPhotographerModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate RKFineArtPhotographerModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/RKFineArtPhotographerModule/` to `/userdata/RKFineArtPhotographerModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/RKFineArtPhotographerModule/` writable including all sub folders.
